# Face-Recognition

AndrewNG Programming Assignment ( CNN specialization ) <br/>

Using Inception model to encode the input image to 128 dimensional vector and computing similarity between the encoded vector and the stored encodings of faces in database <br/>
The model was trained by using triplet loss function to learn how to maximize similarity encoding between similar faces and minimize it for different persons <br/>\
